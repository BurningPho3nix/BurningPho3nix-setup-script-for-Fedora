# THIS DOCUMENT IS BINDING FOR ALL LEADERS

## PREAMBLE
* "THE PROJECT LEADERS" are thereafter referred to as "THE COUNCIL"
* "THE LEADER" is leading THE COUNCIL
* BurningPho3nix is "THE LEADER" until another leader is elected
* As soon as there is a functional council an election for THE LEADER will be done

## YEARLY TASKS
* THE COUNCIL elects "THE LEADER" every year
* "THE LEADER" is getting announced to the community on our social channels

## THE LEADER ELECTION
* To be applicable for being elected as "THE LEADER", the following requirements need to be met:
  - You need to be a part of the council
  - You have to have attended a minimum of 15 Meetings in the last 6 months
  - You need to be active in the project
* The people who want to be elected need to send in an application, including the following:
  - Name
  - YOUR vision for the project
  - additional stuff (optional)
* The application form will be sent to the members of THE COUNCIL a week before the election
* The members of THE COUNCIL keep this form to themselves and DO NOT share the form with any people outside of THE COUNCIL
* Form submissions will be closed 24 hours before the next meeting
* The answers to the form will be submitted to BurningPho3nix and unselfconsciously sorted
* The sorted answers will be presented to the council by BurningPho3nix when the election starts
* The members of THE COUNCIL then vote anonymously
* To be elected as THE LEADER you need to get at least 50.01% of the votes

## THE LEADER
* THE LEADER has the power to decide upon decisions where the votes stand 50% against 50%
* THE LEADER is NOT allowed to make decisions on his/her own, following this the council needs to be involved in every decision
* THE COUNCIL has the power to dismiss THE LEADER at any time if they vote for that and the voting results in 50.01% in favor of dismissing THE LEADER
* In the case that a leader is being dismissed the "THE LEADER ELECTION" clause will start over

## Meetings
* THE COUNCIL has a meeting once every week, on a day that agreed upon in the last meeting
* THE COUNCIL treats every decision agreed upon as public knowledge
* Every member of THE COUNCIL prepares for every meeting, by looking at [Issues](https://github.com/BurningPho3nix/Setup-Tool-for-Fedora/issues) and [Pull requests](https://github.com/BurningPho3nix/Setup-Tool-for-Fedora/pulls) at least an hour before the meeting begins.
* Optional topics:
  - Council members going on vacation
  - Council members leaving
  - New Council members
* THE COUNCIL elects a person to note all attendees, all topics, and their agreed-upon solutions
* The note-taking person needs to note unsolved topics as well and needs to mark those as "unsolved" accordingly
* The notes will get published, by an elected person, on our social channels
